# [Apologetics Club](https://apologetics.club)

Apologetics.club is an independently maintained, not-for-profit site dedicated to providing simple and effective arguments against non-Christian claims. The ultimate goal is that more Christians are equipped to open up the minds of unbelievers to Christ through logic and reasoning.

- The file tree here is standard for a Hugo project, refer to [their docs](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/) if you are unfamiliar with it.
- Keep posts (the markdown files and their associated media) organized by folder in `content/posts/`. An example of this is already present.

### Design

Aim for a "functional minimalist" approach when designing elements on this project. Avoid the distracting and flashy colors and the annoying elements that plague modern websites, such as overlays, share buttons, and genenric corporate design. Stick to the color palette already established, and make the site intuitive, pleasant, and readable for the user.

### Writing

- Read the [Introduction page](https://apologetics.club) on the site first.
- Pages can be submitted via Github's PR system, or directly to me (dan@apologetics.club).
- Keep the writing style formal, but use language that a middle school student and a professor could understand.
- Be inspired by Hemingway and write CONCISELY! (I still need work on this)
- If you have a draft that you want revised, don't be afraid to submit it as a PR.
- CITE CITE CITE. Don't simply write your thoughts, seek out the wisdom of giants.
