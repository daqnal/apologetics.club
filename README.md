# [Apologetics Club](https://apologetics.club)

Apologetics.club is an independently maintained, not-for-profit site dedicated to providing simple and effective arguments against non-Christian claims. The ultimate goal is that more Christians are equipped to open up the minds of unbelievers to Christ through logic and reasoning.

## Technical details

Apologetics.club was made with the [Hugo framework](https://gohugo.io), which makes creating content and seemingly dynamic elements (word counters, post dates, generative indexes, etc...) a piece of cake. 

The design philosophy is functional minimalism, meaning no clutter, just enough for a smooth reading experience. I use [PicoCSS](https://picocss.com) as a lightweight CSS library to quickly make my pages look nice, though I heavily customize the presets. Pico mainly covers boilerplate styling for the site.

Search is handled by [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app), a static, lightweight search library, because the Lord knows I cannot pretend that I know how to create my own site search feature.

As for hosting, the site is deployed on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com), letting me automatically update the site with a `git push`. Cloudflare also handles DNS, custom domain, DDOS protection, metrics, and serving the files quickly. It's all free too, which is epic.
