## Attack

![img name](trilemma.webp)

A trilemma is a difficult choice between three unacceptable options. Attributed to pre-Christ Greek philosopher [Epicurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicurus), this trilemma seems to make the omnipowerful and omni-loving God illogical by offering three non-Christian but logically consistent options.

Here are the premises:

> 1. If God is unable to prevent evil, then he is not all-powerful.
> 2. If God is not willing to prevent evil, then he is not all-good.
> 3. If God is both willing and able to prevent evil, then why does evil exist?

If all the premises are true and accurately defined, then the Christian God cannot be all-powerful and all-good at the same time.

The argument takes many forms in modern debates, often devolving into the **problem of evil**. Other times, the offense attempts to focus on compromising one of God's essential traits.

## Defense

The issue with Epicurus' argument lies not in *logic* but in *definition*. Particularly, there are two terms that are misdefined: **all-good** and **all-powerful**.

### God's Power

Let's tackle **all-powerful** first. The offense's definition of God as being all-powerful probably goes something like this: God can do anything. This statement is a **logical fallacy**, however.
