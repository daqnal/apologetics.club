A man hits a boy. Is this evil? Without context, the natural answer leans toward yes because hitting is violence, which implies that a wrong has been committed. However, knowing the context (or having omniscience) would reveal that a father is punishing his son for running out into the highway. He punishes his son in order to embed the idea that "running on highway = bad" into his child's undeveloped brain. The father isn't committing an evil, he is using temporary pain to prevent the possibility of something worse, death. Finite pain is necessary for future safety. While not perfect by any stretch, this metaphor applies to God and us.
