# About

Apologetics.club is an independently maintained, not-for-profit site dedicated to providing simple and effective arguments against non-Christian claims. The ultimate goal is that more Christians are equipped to open up the minds of unbelievers to Christ through logic and reasoning.

### Contact

If you have any suggestions, corrections, or anything else, you can contact me at [**dan@apologetics.club**](mailto:dan@apologetics.club)

## Technical details

Apologetics.club was made with the [Hugo framework](https://gohugo.io), which makes creating content and seemingly dynamic elements (word counters, post dates, generative indexes, etc...) a piece of cake. 

The design philosophy is functional minimalism, meaning no clutter, just enough for a smooth reading experience. I use [PicoCSS](https://picocss.com) as a lightweight CSS library to quickly make my pages look nice, though I heavily customize the presets. Pico mainly covers boilerplate styling for the site.

Search is handled by [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app), a static, lightweight search library, because the Lord knows I cannot pretend that I know how to create my own site search feature.

As for hosting, the site is deployed on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com), letting me automatically update the site with a `git push`. Cloudflare also handles DNS, custom domain, DDOS protection, metrics, and serving the files quickly. It's all free too, which is epic.

### Open Source

All of the content and code behind apologetics.club is publically available [here](https://github.com/daqnal/apologetics.club) under the MIT license. For those unaware, the free and open source (FOSS) philosophy states that software should be viewable and modifyable by anyone for the sake of privacy, security, ease of use, and the ability to tinker. You can rest assured that at least this site is not spying on you. Anyone can read the code and call me out.

## Why the name?

Not too deep of a reason behind this one. `apologetics.club` wasn't taken, and it sounds kinda cool ðŸ˜Ž

## Personal details

The inspiration for making this site came from my high school apologetics teacher. Ante apologetics class, I had little passionate interest in the Bible; you could've called me a child in the faith. However, I knew that I wanted to love doing something with God's word and that I had skills to do something useful. God's answer to my prayers was that class. My interest grew and grew, and soon enough I decided to begin work on an apologetics-related project around October 2023 during my senior year of high school. Computer science has long been my passion, and combined with my newfound love for apologetics, this site was born. My hope is that this site helps Christians in conversation and debates and that someone, even if it is just one person, opens his or her mind to the faith.
