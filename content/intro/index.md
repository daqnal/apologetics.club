## How to use this site

Before reading articles, there are some fundamental ideas worth noting for effective reading, logged here:

#### 1. Without love, you are nothing

Love before logic. Jesus said this way better than I ever could, so I'll leave you with some of the words he inspired first:

*And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.* 1 Corinthians 13:2

*Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer each person.* Colossians 4:6

*And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes. Rather, ***speaking the truth in love***, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.* Ephesians 4:11-16

Keep the fruit of the spirit in your heart when you talk with non-Christians, especially in heated debates. Gentleness and kindness will make more of a difference in their hearts than logic in many scenarios. Above all, remain **humble**. Speak with authority, but without superiority. So many of the lost shut themselves out from Christianity because of past experiences with Christians who only bring half of the story of condemnation **and** redemption. Hellfire and lovey-lovey-dovey talk end in error by themselves, so whenever you attack someone's argument, remember that the human underneath is the same one you were without Christ.

#### 2. Humans will never **prove** or **disprove** Chrsitianity

*There will always be enough light for those who want to see, but there will always be enough darkness for those who want to live in darkness.*
\- Brandon McGuire, [*Daily Dose of Wisdom*](https://youtube.com/channel/UC0A9YrHgD5hZ2JXQrxRPHsw)

Don't misunderstand this principle. Logic does not go against God; in fact, to Christians, logic is proof of God. The truth is that people see abstract concepts like logic, good, beauty, et cetera differently based on environmental biases and personal beliefs. No matter what *proof* an atheist puts forward that God does not exit, Christians will disagree with a definition or some detail then proceed to dismiss the argument. The same goes the other way. 

Take for example **beauty**. It is a strong case for Christianity. Why does the atheist think mountains are beautiful? Is it contributing to their evolutionary needs? Doesn't it suggest design rather than randomness? Despite this argument, atheists may wriggle their way around the attack or simply accept that beauty is a random byproduct of evolution with no meaning.

The point of apologetics is not to prove the existence of what is by essence supernatural, it is to show that God is not incompatible with reality. From a non-religious perspective, God is *possible*, maybe even *likely*. Use this content to show that to the world.
